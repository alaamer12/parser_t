# About
this project is a practice on how to make different kind of parsers


# Those are Parsers Types:


We will focus on first five, also we will try not to use any builtin or third party library and do it with our own and we have to try to practice binary representation

i have chose to make this project to get better about different kind of parsers

## Data Parser:
Used to parse and extract data from various sources such as files, databases, or network streams. These parsers are often used in data processing applications to extract meaningful information from raw data.

## Markup Parser:
Used to parse markup languages such as HTML, XML, or Markdown. Markup parsers are used in web development, document processing, and content management systems to interpret and render structured content.

## Configuration Parser: 
Used to parse configuration files in formats such as JSON, YAML, or INI. Configuration parsers are used in software applications to read and apply configuration settings.

## Log Parser:
Used to parse log files generated by software applications or systems. Log parsers are used for analyzing and extracting useful information from log data, such as errors, warnings, or performance metrics.

# Query Parser:
Used to parse query languages such as SQL or search query languages. Query parsers are used in database systems and search engines to interpret and execute user queries.

## Natural Language Parser:
Used to parse natural language text to extract meaning or perform syntactic analysis. Natural language parsers are used in natural language processing (NLP) applications such as chatbots, sentiment analysis, and language translation.
